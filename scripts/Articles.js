It’s also quite funny, like, why would someone create a cryptocurrency out of a dog meme?</p><p>Jackson Palmer introduced Dogecoin to the world in December 2013. Since then, Dogecoin has seen both bullish and bearish markets and has simultaneously earned a reputation as a “tipping” currency – meaning you can tip someone instantly using Dogecoins instead of valueless upvotes, likes, and re-tweets. Dogecoin is famously known as the “joke currency”.</p><p>Palmer did indeed found the cryptocurrency as a joke, but he did so under the motivation of many people who re-tweeted Jackson’s idea several times.",

        "content" : "</p>When Dogecoin debuted in December of 2014 it was greeted with great enthusiasm from fans of the Doge meme, and equally great skepticism about it’s viability from pretty much everyone else.</p><p>Despite this uncertainty, the value of the new cryptocurrency rose rapidly leading the community to adopt the slogan “To the Moon!” as a rallying cry. Doge soon found itself in 3rd place on the Cryptocurrency Marketcap listings, and in just 90 days it had achieved a market cap of $90 million. And then, the rocket ran out of gas. After peaking on February 12 the value of Doge began a long, sustained drop in both total market cap, and individual unit price. There was an expectation in March that the downward slide would end after the community successfully raised $55,000 to sponsor NASCAR driver Josh Wise.</p><p>Unfortunately, this did not happen and there was no real spike in Doge value until a three day period between April 14 and April 17 where $22 million dollars was pumped into the market before the slide resumed. Despite this, the Doge community continued to cheer on their currency, defiantly resisting the reality of the slow, inexorable decline. Their 87,000 strong community continued to post cheerful photos, positive memes, and generally behave in the carefree, highly positive manner that has been their trademark from the start</p>",

        "type" : "News",
        "fragment" : "A group of supporters has raised more than $25,000 in the internet currency Dogecoin to let the Jamaican bobsleigh team attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi.",
        "content" : "<p>On 19/01/2015, news broke that the team had qualified for the Winter Olympics for the first time since 2002. The two-man sled will be piloted by Winston Watt, a 46-year-old Jamaican-American who also competed in 2002, with Marvin Dixon as the brakeman.</p><p>But Watt revealed that, even after putting his own money up to fly the team to his training session, there wasn't enough money to send the two to Russia. As a result, he turned to donations, launching a PayPal account to pay for the estimated $40,000.</p><p>The Jamaican bobsleigh team achieved international fame after qualifying for the 1988 Winter Olympics with a team of four men who had very little experience in the sport. That fame was boosted with the release of Cool Runnings in 1993, a loosely fictionalised account of their trials. The film remains a cult hit, and fans spread word of Watt's plight.</p><p>One of them was Liam Butler, who runs the Dogecoin foundation along with the currency's initial creators Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus. Dogecoin is a crypto-currency, based on a combination of bitcoin, the popular digital money, and Doge, the internet meme that superimposes broken English written in Comic Sans onto pictures of Shiba Inu dogs.\"</p><p>As someone who grew up in the 90's, Cool Runnings was the ultimate feel good movie about underdogs out of their element achieving their dreams,\" Butler told the Guardian. \"When I was about 7 years old, my best friend and I had a billy-cart that his dad built. When we would start our run down his driveway, we would shout out the catchphrase from the movie: 'Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it's bobsled time!'\"</p><p>On Monday in Sydney, where he lives, Butler launched Dogesled, aiming to raise some of the money required to send Watt and Dixon to Sochi. \"We started without a concrete plan in mind,\" Butler says. \"I sent a few emails out… but that was the extent of it.\"Within a few hours, however, the fundraiser had collected just over 26m Dogecoins. So many people had been donating, in fact, that they seemed to raise the price of the currency itself; in 12 hours, the Dogecoin to Bitcoinexchange rate rose by 50%.</p><p>\"Myself and Jackson Palmer (the creator of Dogecoin) were at a local pub trivia in Sydney when we noticed the value of Dogecoin had more than doubled since we'd last checked so we raced back to my house to ensure we could get the best price for the donations in a form the team could actually use. As much as we have faith in Dogecoin to become the community currency of the internet, we still understand that the team need to buy their airfares in a fiat currency.\"</p><p>At the exchange rate Butler secured, he has $25,000 ready to send to the bobsleigh team, and the donations continue to flood in. It looks like the Jamaican bobsleigh team might be going to Sochi.</p>",

        "content" : "<p>Fresh from its success sending Jamaica's bobsled team to the Winter Olympics, Reddit's Dogecoin community has raised 67m Doge, worth £33,000, to send a car to the iconic Talladega Superspeedway Nascar race.<p><p>Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which was born out of a combination of the original digital money, bitcoin, and the Doge meme, which features photos of a baffled yet placid Shiba Inu with broken English written in multicoloured Comic Sans over the top.</p><p>The sponsorship fundraiser began when members of Reddit's Nascar community identified up-and-coming driver Josh Wise as an underdog in need of financial support.</p><p>The group appealed to the Dogecoin community for help, and after an eight-day fundraising drive, 1,200 donations averaging $41 were enough to sponsor his car, covering it in images of dogecoin and the Reddit alien. Moolah, a cryptocurrency payment platform, offered to convert the donations to US dollars at a favourable exchange rate, ensuring that the whole $55,000 raised could be spent.</p><p>\"I can't thank the dogecoin and Reddit community enough for the support,\" said Wise, before quoting what has become an unofficial slogan of the Dogecoin community: \"To the moon!\"</p><p>Named the \"#98 Moonrocket\", the car will make its debut on May 4th at the Aarons 499 Sprint Series Cup Race.</p><p>Dogecoin hit headlines in January when the same community raised $25,000 to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the winter olympics. Since then, it has also has raised $20,000 to train service dogs for children with disabilities, and collected $30,000 to build clean water wells in Kenya.</p>",
